## Starting a game

Once you are logged on, you will received various html messages, such as the banner. The important one is the `set_game_links` message. In this message, you will receive the `game_id`. In the `content` of that message, you will find game_ids, such as `#play-dcss-web-trunk` and `#play-seeded-web-trunk` as html. If the `#play-` portion is removed, this can be sent back to DCSS webtile to start the game. 

```json
SENT: 
    {"msg": "play", "game_id": "seeded-web-trunk"}
RECEIVED (if good game_id): 
    {"msg": "game_started"}
RECEIVED (if bad game_id):
    {"msg": "go_lobby"}
```

Once the game is started, it will send various data such as `player` information, `ui` messages, `msgs` from the log and `map` data and the game will accept any of the standard keyboard inputs.
